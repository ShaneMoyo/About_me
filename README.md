# About_me

#Welcome to my about me page!
Thank you for visiting! As you can see I attached 2 JavaScript files app2.js and app3.js. app2.js is my original Javascript file while app3.js is an experiment I did which tries to build each question using a question builder function and a few arrays containing string. It is fairly hard to read but, I learned a lot about functions giving it a shot! Currently app3.js is linked to my index.html file.
